# Chat Component Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of the chat functionality in the OpenCode mobile application according to the plan outlined in `docs/chat-screen-breakdown.md`. The refactoring was completed in 5 phases:

## Phase 1: Extract Utilities & Types
Created utility functions and type definitions to separate business logic from UI components.

### Files Created:
- `src/types/chat.ts` - Type definitions for chat-related interfaces
- `src/utils/chat/tokenCalculation.ts` - Token calculation and formatting utilities
- `src/utils/chat/messageHelpers.ts` - Message helper functions
- `src/utils/chat/index.ts` - Export utilities

## Phase 2: Create Custom Hooks
Extracted business logic into reusable React hooks following the single responsibility principle.

### Files Created:
- `src/hooks/useSessionManager.ts` - Session state and loading logic
- `src/hooks/useModelSelection.ts` - Provider/model selection logic
- `src/hooks/useMessageOperations.ts` - Message sending and image handling
- `src/hooks/useCommandExecution.ts` - Command parsing and execution
- `src/hooks/useChutesIntegration.ts` - Chutes quota and API key management
- `src/hooks/useConnectionRecovery.ts` - Connection status monitoring
- `src/hooks/index.ts` - Export hooks

## Phase 3: Create UI Components
Extracted UI elements into separate, focused components.

### Files Created:
- `src/components/chat/ChatHeader.tsx` - Session header with provider/model selection
- `src/components/chat/ChatEmptyState.tsx` - Empty state handling
- `src/components/chat/ChatErrorBanner.tsx` - Error display and dismissal
- `src/components/chat/ChatInputBar.tsx` - Message input and send controls
- `src/components/chat/ChatStatusBar.tsx` - Status information display
- `src/components/chat/ModelSelectionDialogs.tsx` - Provider/model selection dialogs
- `src/components/chat/ChatScreen.tsx` - Main container component
- `src/components/chat/index.ts` - Export components

## Phase 4: Refactor Main Component
Integrated all custom hooks and replaced inline UI with new components in a simplified main component.

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
Created unit tests for utilities and components, and organized exports for better maintainability.

### Files Created:
- `__tests__/utils/chat/tokenCalculation.test.ts` - Tests for token calculation utilities
- `__tests__/utils/chat/messageHelpers.test.ts` - Tests for message helper functions
- `__tests__/components/chat/ChatErrorBanner.test.tsx` - Tests for ChatErrorBanner component
- `__tests__/hooks/useSessionManager.test.tsx` - Tests for useSessionManager hook

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is now in hooks, UI in components
2. **Testability**: Each hook and utility can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused elsewhere
4. **Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
5. **Performance**: Better optimization opportunities with focused components
6. **Type Safety**: Clear interfaces between components
7. **Debugging**: Easier to isolate issues in smaller components

## File Size Reduction
- Original chat.tsx: ~1500 lines
- New structure:
  - Main component: ~150 lines
  - Each hook: ~100-200 lines
  - Each UI component: ~50-100 lines
  - Utilities: ~50 lines each
  - Types: ~100 lines

This structure maintains all existing features while making the code much more manageable and maintainable.

## Code Quality
All linting issues have been resolved and all tests are passing, ensuring the refactored code meets the project's quality standards.
